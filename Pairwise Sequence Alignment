# Introduction to Pairwise Sequence Alignment
Pairwise Sequence Alignment is a type of sequence alignment used to identify similar regions that may indicate relationships between two biological sequences. 
This relationship could be functional, structural, evolutionary, or a combination of two or more of these relationships. 
The biological sequences could also be nucleic acid or protein. As opposed to Pairwise Sequence Alignment, Multiple Sequence Alignment is the alignment of more thn 2 biological sequences of similar length.

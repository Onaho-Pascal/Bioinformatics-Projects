# Bioinformatics Projects
This repository houses my bioinformatics projects including steps and notes about each one.  
In addition, this **README** has short explanations or introductory sessions about each topic and project.
The projects include:  
* Pairwise Sequence Alignment
* Multiple Sequence Alignment
* Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
* BLAST Search Engine
* Quality Control of Next Generation Sequencing Experiments
* NGS: Computational Analysis
* Mapping of Reads to Genome
* Variant Calling
* Unsupervised Machine Learning
* Using K-means in Weka
* KNN and Decision Tree Algorithms
* Clustering with a Genetic Algorithm
* Artificial Neural Networks

# Pairwise Alignment of c-fos Protein and ATF3 Protein.
The c-Fos protein is a proto-oncogene homologous to the retroviral oncogene: v-Fos and It was first discovered in rat fibroblasts.
The c-fos protein is a cell cycle controller at the G0/G1 checkpoint. 
It plays an important role in many cellular functions and has been found to be over expressed in a variety of cancers.
The ATF3 Protein also called the Activating transcription factor 3 protein and is a part of the mammalian activation transcription factor/cAMP responsive element-binding (CREB) protein family of transcription factors.

# Local and Global amino acid sequence alignments for the c-FOS and ATF3 Protein using the EMBOSS Needle (Global) and Water (Local) tool. ðŸ§¬
* Local Alignment identifies and aligns the most similar subsections of two sequences. It is useful for finding regions of similarity within sequences that might be divergent overall.
* Global Alignment aligns the entire length of two sequences from start to end. It is useful when the sequences are of similar length and expected to be similar over their whole length.
